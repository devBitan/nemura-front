## Project Description
Riwi Link-up-ms is a robust WebAPI developed in C# using ASP.NET Core, designed to power and connect with database the Riwi LinKUp platform. This comprehensive backend solution facilitates efficient matching between Riwi clients with coders, emphasizing in their personal information and projects.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This API forms the foundation of Riwi LinKUp platform, enabling seamless connections between frontend and backend.

## Key Features

- **User and Coder Profile Management**: Comprehensive CRUD operations for managing user and coder profiles.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Sophisticated system for filtering coder profiles based on various criteria.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Secure JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
- **Admin Interface**: Dedicated endpoints for administrative tasks and bulk updates.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Endpoints providing valuable insights on coder demographics and platform usage.

## Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)

The API utilizes a variety of DTOs to ensure efficient and secure data transfer between the client and server:

- **UserDto**: For basic user information transfer
- **RegisterUserDto**: Specifically for user registration processes- **RegisterUserDto**: Specifically for user registration processes
- **LoginUserDto**: Handles login credentials
- **CoderDtoV1** and **CoderDtoV2**: Different versions for coder data representation
- **CoderCreationDto**: Used when creating new coder profiles
- **CoderUpdateDto**: For updating existing coder information
- **CoderResponseDto**: Comprehensive DTO for detailed coder information responses

> [!TIP]
> The use of DTOs helps in maintaining a clear separation between the internal data model and the data exposed via the API, enhancing security and flexibility.

# Technical Overview

## API Architecture
- Implemented using ASP.NET Core Web API
- Follows RESTful principles for endpoint design
- Utilizes Entity Framework Core for ORM capabilities

## Core Functionalities

### Account Management
- Endpoints:
  - `POST /api/v1/account/register`
  - `POST /api/v1/account/login`

> [!NOTE]
> The Account Controller handles user registration and authentication.

### Coder Profile Management
- CRUD operations for coder profiles
- Endpoints: 
  - `GET /api/v1/coders`
  - `GET /api/v1/coders/{id}`
  - `GET /api/v2/coders`
  - `GET /api/v2/coders/{id}`
  - `POST /api/v2/coders`
  - `PUT /api/v2/coders/{id}`
  - `PATCH /api/v2/coders/{id}`
  - `DELETE /api/v2/coders/{id}`
    
> [!CAUTION]
> Be careful when using the DELETE endpoint as it permanently removes a user from the system.

> [!TIP]
> The v2 endpoints provide more detailed and flexible operations for coder profiles.

### Coder Profile Management (v3)
- Advanced filtering for coder profiles
- Endpoint:
  - `GET /api/v3/coders/filter`
    - **Description**: Filters coders based on various optional query parameters.
    - **Query Parameters**:
      - `clanId` (optional): Filter by clan ID.
      - `genderId` (optional): Filter by gender ID.
      - `languageIds`: List of language IDs to filter by.
      - `technicalSkillIds`: List of technical skill IDs to filter by.
      - `softSkillIds`: List of soft skill IDs to filter by.

> [!TIP]
> This endpoint returns a list of coders matching the specified criteria, including related data such as gender, clan, and skills.

### User Management
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/v1/user`
  - `GET /api/v1/user/email/{email}`
  - `PATCH /api/v1/user/{email}`
  - `DELETE /api/v1/user/{email}`

> [!CAUTION]
> Be careful when using the DELETE endpoint as it permanently removes a user from the system. 

### Dashboard
- Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/dashboard/coders-in-training`
  - `GET /api/dashboard/frontend-coders`
  - `GET /api/dashboard/backend-coders`
  - `GET /api/dashboard/companies-by-month`

> [!TIP]
> These endpoints provide valuable insights for administrative purposes.

## Authentication and Authorization
- Implements JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure API access
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for user and admin functionalities

> [!WARNING]
> Always keep your JWT secret key secure and never expose it in client-side code.

## Database Design
- Utilizes PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Includes tables for Coders, Users and relational mapping tables

> [!NOTE]
> The API is designed with scalability in mind, utilizing PostgreSQL for data storage and incorporating performance optimizations like caching and asynchronous programming.

> [!TIP]
> Consider implementing caching for endpoints that return data that doesn't change frequently.

## API Features
- Pagination support for large data sets
- Sorting and filtering capabilities on relevant endpoints
- Data validation and error handling middleware

## Integration Points
- Endpoints designed for seamless integration with the frontend application
- Supports both JSON and XML response formats for flexibility

## Deployment and Scalability
- Containerized using Docker for easy deployment
- Designed for horizontal scalability in cloud environments

> [!NOTE]
> The system's architecture ensures that administrators can easily update and manage coder information, keeping the talent pool aligned with market demands and project objectives.
